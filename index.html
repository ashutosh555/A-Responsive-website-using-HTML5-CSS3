            <p>MS Dhoni after winning 2007 T20I WC became the full time captain of Indian cricket team.
              It was almost 28 years since India have won 50 over world cup and it was India's best chance as
              the world cup was played in India. First match was against Bangladesh where Virender Sehwag smoked 175
              runs alone and a young batsman Virat Kohli making his debut in world cup scored 1st hundred in world cup. India
              scored a mamuth total of 390. India won that game.The next match was against England. Sachin scored a brilliant 
              hundred in that match but not good enough for a win. Match drawn. India won theit next two games i.e against Ireland & Netherlands comfortably.
              5th match was against South Africa and India lost that game. Last group match was against West Indies and India won 
              that game comfortably and qualified for the knockouts. The opponent team was mighty Australia in QF.
              India defeated the aussies and qualified for semi-final. In the semi-final
              against Pakistan it was India's bowling that made the difference. India won against Pakistan and moved to Mumbai
              for the final match against Sri Lanka. In the final match Sri Lanka posted 274 runs. India
              required 275 runs to win. Two wickets fell in quick time.
              Virat and Gautam settled the innings and Virat got out in a crucial stage. Then MS Dhoni came to bat. He didn't
              had a great world cup so far but in final he proved his worth. Then Gambhir got out on 97! but, Dhoni stayed at
              one end & finished the match off with a gignatic SIX. He remained not out on 91. Dhoni was player of the match and
              Yuvraj was player of the tournament. India became <b>CHAMPIONS OF THE WORLD</b> after 28 years.</p>
